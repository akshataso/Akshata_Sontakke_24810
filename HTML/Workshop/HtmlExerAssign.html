            A random paragraph can also be an excellent way for a writer to tackle writers' block. Writing block can
            often
            happen due to being stuck with a current project that the writer is trying to complete. By inserting a
            completely random paragraph from which to begin, it can take down some of the issues that may have been
            causing
            the writers' block in the first place.
